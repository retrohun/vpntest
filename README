README for vpntest.sh

Testing availability of specific ports on one or more hosts is often needed.
This can be achieved by a number of tools eg. telnet, nmap. 
vpntest.sh uses netcat to do the scanning/testing to it is required to have nc installed (and to have execute permission on it)

Goals of this script are:
- batch processing of input
- provide just enough data to tell if a port is available or not

Dependency: nc

Example input file content:
$> cat testaddr
127.0.0.1,22
192.168.1.1,3
kiskutya
192.167.1224.3,4

Example run on previous file:
$> ./vpntest.sh testaddr
Connection to 127.0.0.1 on port 22 is OK!
Connection to 192.168.1.1 on port 3 is NOK, message: nc: connect to 192.168.1.1 port 3 (tcp) timed out: Operation now in progress
./vpntest.sh: Warning - Bad IP address found: kiskutya
./vpntest.sh: Warning - Bad IP address found: 192.167.1224.3
